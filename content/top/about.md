![](/img/display_picture.jpg)  Hey, I am **_Pradeep Peter Murmu_**, and this is my blog called **"Pomegranade"**.

Why is it called "Pomegranade"? Well, it's a word play on "Pomegranate" and "Granade". Technically, I'm just trying to connect the dots looking backwards because I wanted one word name for my blog which could act like a metaphor to my writings and also had a hint of personal story behind it.

Pomegranate as a fruit has immense nutritional value. Whenever anybody felt sick at my home, my father used to get pomegranate from the market and immediately make its juice. I don't know at what level does pomegranate lie in the nutritional fruits heirarchy but it was definitely considered the top most at our home. Pomegranate as a fruit is not easy to eat. It has numerous beads inside it and takes a lot of effort to pick beads and eat. I remember Biswa's stand-up comparing [bananas and pomegranate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkLmfIxi3No), in which he mocks how difficult it is to eat a pomegranate. It's such a tedious task that anybody's last memory of eating pomegranate is either with their parents or grandparents because only they would take the efforts to peel it off and serve. Pomegranate is definitely a nostalgia pill. I feel a lot of my writing can make you remember memories from childhood or give a scent of nostalgia after reading. The numerous beads inside the protective cover of pomegranate is about how I want to keep writing about a lot of stuff. Since, my work consumes a large part of my day, I also try to write on Tech, Products and Start-ups.

The "Granade" in the word play is about the impact I want to achieve. I try to write on society and cultures because that's the most powerful category of writings. Ultimately it's the society that we want to change and improve. I might be wrong or uninformed regarding some social topics but I'm always open to discussion and improvement.

In short, it's the documentation of everything I do in my life. My interests, thoughts, ideas, projects, perspective, commentary, verses, stories and shitposts, it's like my human embodiment.

Lastly, 'Anar dana' is made from pomegranate and is one of her favourite things. So, yes, "Pomegranade" is too personal.
