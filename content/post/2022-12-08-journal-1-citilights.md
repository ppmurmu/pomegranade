It’s the 7th of December, 2021 and finally, I realised I have not been documenting my Noida experiences even though I moved here about three months ago. Three months is an ample amount of time to start liking or disliking a place but Noida isn’t one of those places you’d even think about doing the former. Apparently, it also proved my confirmation bias.

Whenever I visit a new place, I like to know about its history. I had been living in Delhi for the past four years for my undergraduate studies and whenever I used to come to East Delhi, specifically the Okhla, Jamia area for some good non-vegetarian food, I used to find barricades with “New Okhla Industrial Development Area” written on it. That was when I realised Noida is simply an acronym for someplace created to serve the exponential growth of Delhi. Since the area is fairly new, obviously there’s no history about Noida specifically, other than some great armies attacking Delhi from the east might have taken rest in its forest a day before battles. This brings me to the thought of how a lush green forest had to be destroyed to create a concrete jungle. There is a bird sanctuary at the Delhi-Noida border called Okhla bird sanctuary. One might find a good view of it while travelling on the Magenta line towards the Botanical garden station. The swamp plants cover the lake portion of the sanctuary formed out of the water from the soon-to-be-dead Yamuna. It basically acts as a cover-up for the toxic froths of Yamuna. A person watching from their high rise tower apartment of Noida would find it a thing of beauty but don’t ask the neighbourhood crows that go there to drink water. The only beauty that people cherish in concrete jungles are high rise towers and Noida really has a thing for it. I’ve found more than ten high rise towers which are not functional probably due to legal reasons. Some of them surround the lake and are a poetic counterpart of it in terms of what they both represent. I can maybe shoot a music video in one of those tall buildings still under construction.
