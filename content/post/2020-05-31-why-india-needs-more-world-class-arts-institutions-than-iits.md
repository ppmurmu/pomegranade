Subjects don’t have hierarchy, but in India it does like every other thing. India’s political, economical and societal structure is unknowingly affected by this butterfly effect.

Indians worldwide are known for being hard working, diligent employees. One of the pole-bearers for this reputation was built by India’s IITian export to the western world. IITians, considered to be la crème de crème of Indian education system are just the right people for the right job in the west, working hard to have not let the reputation fall. The courses in IITs are also very rigorous and it trains them well to stand out wherever they are. No doubt the requirement to get into IITs is also a very rigorous process requiring sacrifices from a very young age. Don’t worry, this is not a click-bait anti-IIT post because there’s nothing wrong with IITs. It’s a great place producing brilliant engineers. India has thousands of engineering colleges, courtesy to Indian parent’s obsession with science. It’s not their fault that they were made to believe during 80’s and 90’s when India had its technological boom, that science was the only way to get a job. Today it isn’t the case, there are jobs in almost every field.

Colleges are places where majority of young people develop their conscience. They understand people, politics, different culture and many life lessons which so many people have acknowledged even in their TEDx speeches. When you look at it this way, you’d understand what importance this place holds the value in building a person’s rationality and thought process. Eventually, this thought process trickles down to their political identity and shapes government and ultimately the society.

So what’s with the IITs and engineering college rant in the beginning?

Since I talked about how colleges are important places in a person’s thought process, IITs and engineering colleges are places where students are mostly geared up for career. You wouldn’t find much involvement of these colleges in national level student politics or even in social issues. Is this wrong? Obviously not. The students studying there are paying a lot higher than arts or normal college students and to waste time in issues which doesn’t really affect their career would be stupid. The courses and semesters are already jam packed for them to take out time to think beyond syllabus or to develop enough emotional quotient to talk about social issues. Some might argue that they involve themselves in projects to solve social issues. Yes, which is true, and also that it is more about the technology to solve the issue than the empathy towards it. I might argue about this in some other post but for now just get the overview.

Most of the students led protests against government and injustice have been actively participated by students of arts/non-technical colleges. People argue that the students in these colleges don’t study and that’s why they involve themselves in such activities. The fact that academics isn’t the sole thing on which life runs is very important to understand here. Not denying that their academic load is far less than students of technical colleges, but when your academics involve thinking beyond textbooks and gives you ample time to philosophies and develop rationality, these are things on which they will question. Student’s political representation is an important thing in a democracy because it builds the future for their generation.

Since technical colleges don’t give enough time to its students to develop certain emotional quotient towards different social issues, a lot of time they remain conservative like their parents or the background from which they come. They don’t really choose to be conservative, but it happens to be the only option because they never really got time to think beyond it. That political identity ultimately shapes government and society. I’m talking about the majority here so in case you disagree, I’m glad to know. The status quo is that the viewpoint of people from these institutions are highly regarded in the society which correlates it to ideal or so called “good/correct” behavior. Most end up becoming policy makers in corporations or some even joining civil services. I’m not accusing these people of being less empathetic but when majority of people from this background hold resources and position of responsibilities, it sets a culture. A person holding a degree in Indian history would obviously have more empathy towards the struggling class of society rather than some logic-oriented person who would end arguments with “survival of the fittest”. Some might argue that more all-round development of students in technical colleges with added humanities courses would help. Certainly, it does, and it is being practiced in various top technical institutions.

Nevertheless, the fact that India lacks world class arts institutions is a matter of concern because students in their early age of deciding career path end up choosing science not because of highly advanced science institutions but because of underdeveloped arts/non-science institutions and lack of options, otherwise most graduates from technical institutes wouldn’t shift to MBA programs or civil services later in their career. Even though statistics might show that science field has more job opportunities but aren’t jobs created because of the development of particular sector with the help of government? Arts institutions were never really given much importance in our society and hence government never really worked on creating sectors where graduates from these institutions could be employed.

India has such a vast history associated with present socio-economic classes that it needs better policy makers to decide upon the fair treatment of every class. This can be achieved not by some foreign return graduates, multinational consultants or highly smart people but by having more practical, wise, diverse, understanding and empathetic group of people homegrown in our own world class arts institutions.

Asking the government for institutions where free thinking would be encouraged is like asking a king to adopt democracy. Well this will be a debate for another day.
