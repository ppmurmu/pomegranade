The basic fundamental of product management is just getting shit done on time. But getting shit done on time is hard since a lot of things ain’t under your control. To tackle those, people created some principles, theories and good practices to achieve what you want as a good product manager. Here’s one such good practice if you’re dealing with a software product.

Know what you want to achieve and, most importantly, by when. This will help you set a realistic deadline for you and for your team. If the product to be delivered has multiple features, let’s say 9, try to divide it into multiple stage products. The first stage will have 3 features and the next with another 3, and the last with all the features. You can divide it into more stages, but it is important to divide the product into stages because it will help you do testing before you move to the next stage. Testing in a product cycle is what finds the bug or corrects what might have gone during the development. Dividing the product into stages and testing helps in easy and early rectification of the error. Sometimes, testing as a whole at the end of the product cycle causes more time and effort in rectification which could’ve been avoided had it been tested early at simpler stages of the product. As rectification would also take time, your product timeline must incorporate for this time. 

This practice might seem like increasing your product timeline, but a good suggestion would be to reduce the planned development time of each stage by 20%-30% and allotting this to testing and rectification. Testing and feedbacks sometimes change a lot of aspects of the product. If it is ultimately going to be changed, it is better for the development team to spend a little less time on developing it and transferring that time to post-testing rectification.
