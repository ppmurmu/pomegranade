Every time I board a metro, I go into one of my favourite zones of deep thinking. Do you know those calm and serene places where you just want to pause life and think about life? Remember how those places made you feel? Yes, exactly the opposite of that feeling. 

Metros are crowded, wobbly, periodically accelerating and decelerating. Nothing in it is stable; people board and deboard; people on seats look tired, and the ones standing are waiting to pounce at vacant seat any moment. At peak hours, it’s nothing short of chaos. Why would it be my favourite zones of deep thinking? No, I’m not a fan of oxymorons. It’s none of that chaotic solitude when you realise everybody is around, but inside, you’re empty and other similar feelings. I really prefer similes. It’s simple, it’s self-explanatory, and it delivers what you intended to. Sometimes people even infer more than what you intended because similes ignite a chain of similes like a train or like nursery rhymes or like …–

Metro journeys are long, at least that’s what my experience has been. Most of my journeys are more than forty minutes, thanks to my beloved living across the city. That forty-minute would seem like a time you’d wanna kill somehow but I really found my zone of deep thinking there. Obviously, you want to know why it is that and I must tell you my answer is going to be very disappointing. I simply observe. When you observe, you think, and when you think long enough, you reach the deep thinking stage. But why one of my favourites? Now that is a very subjective thing to answer but if you could afford only one jacket, it probably would be your favourite one right? Normally, people deep think while sitting on the commode or while watching ceiling fan at three in the night or while taking a walk in dusk. I have a great stool, fall asleep in minutes and it’s been a while since I actually caught dusk. I must tell you, who’s had his constipation days, thoughts on a metro journey are entirely different from what you might get while sitting on a commode. This might sound intuitive because of the stark comparison and the things that encompass you in those two places but it’s about the thoughts. It’s about the protagonist in the thoughts. In all the three places mentioned before where people normally deep think, the protagonist is mostly you or somebody but related to you. The metro journey is different for me, this is the place where the protagonist in the thoughts changes to the person I’m observing. I try to create their story, their reasons, their beliefs. It’s complete imagination which even in the wildest dream can’t come true. It’s like a canvas but with outlines and my job is to fill colour.

Metros are like a box of chocolates, you never know what you’re gonna get. Metros are like sitcoms, after a while it’s just similar experience. Similes can bridge feelings between two entirely different things. It’s simple yet ignites so much of thoughts. The forty minutes of my metro journey is a big simile of what I see and infer. The only way I can create stories out of faces and events in the metro is by connecting them to any other face, story, idea or event I have known or experienced. “He was like the shrewd man from that movie”, “She stared at the old woman’s watch like a niffler from magical beast”. The multifarious faces I encounter during the whole journey gives me numerous pilot stories to begin with. I might exit one in between or they might exit the metro in between. A lot of my stories remain incomplete. The chaotic changes in plots and timeline of my stories with one character boarding and the other deboarding are similar to what metros are in nature. When the metros travel underground, their windows reflect their own light. Some are seeing themselves in the reflection and I have twice the number of faces to read from. Wait, Is that person carrying a cat inside their bag? No, it can’t be, it’s too small for a cat. But what if they did? Do you think their workplace allows pets? Their workplace can’t be far from the station they boarded. Seems like they’re deboarding at the next station. I think I got enough to spin stories around a well off corporate employee living in sub-par areas to pay off his college debts.

The metro decelerates with a screeching sound causing my stack of stories to topple. I’m trying to rebuild it but can’t find the correct order. I’ll just leave it there like some scattered Jenga pieces. I don’t remember what those stories contained but I remember the feeling while creating those. It’s like chaos and you’re in the middle of it. I don’t want to pause in between the chaos and think about any other thing. The chaos is the typewriter and the bustling sound of the railway track is its stroke noise. The keys are the faces. My forty minutes of ink is too less.

It’s like a library full of books that cannot talk to each other but they are sitting right beside each other. A magical book appears to be judging other books by their back cover blurbs and creating its own library. Some books are falling off the shelf and there’s nobody to place them back. That book will never be replaced and there are numerous other libraries like this.
