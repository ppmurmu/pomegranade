I really have a hard time answering questions like “What are you doing these days?” or “How’s it going?”. These questions are asked with the expectation that you’d be doing the single most important thing at that point in your life. If you’re in college, then your answer would probably be, “Just in my senior year of economics honours”. If you’re in a job then, “Working full time with Sean Baker’s Associates”. Most answers stop at that single most important thing. Surprisingly, for most people, this would not even be the single most important thing in their lives at that point, yet they say these answers. We have been cultured to think this way, that our life’s purpose is to find that one goal and work hard enough to achieve it. I mean, the question of life’s purpose is itself debatable but for the time being, let’s just simplify ‘purpose’ in terms of society. The society’s framework is simple. It’s tried and tested, and most importantly, it works well for the majority of the population. The massive chunk of the population, and probably even me, lie in that bell curve where the safest bet is to always choose the road that everybody’s taking. No, I’m not Robert Frost, and this blog isn’t about suggesting you take the road less travelled. What if you took the road that everybody travelled, but the purpose wasn’t about the destination?. The journey each of us has on that same road is eccentrically different. The milestones are similar for everybody on this road, but the things happening between those milestones are not. Some might be taking a detour before arriving on that same milestone, and some might be just confused about whether they are on the correct road or not. Nevertheless, both are ultimately going to pass through the same milestone. Still, both will have very different experiences, yet when questioned about “what are you doing these days”, they will reply, “Oh, just reached the milestone”.

There’s a very interesting chapter in Yuval Noah Harari’s Sapiens. He talks about how humans aren’t made for one work and how capitalism sucked the essence of craftsmanship from man. We are made to believe that humans can only be good at one thing. Logically it’s true because if you’re spending one-third of your day on one activity, then you obviously become better at it than the ones not doing it. This system works well for the well oiled capitalistic system to increase efficiency. Harari then argues about how this efficiency comes at the cost of mental burnout and a sense of lost identity, that we are just a replaceable piece in a jigsaw puzzle with no identity. The dissatisfied generation looking for cults and purpose is what we have become. Yes, surely we have means of entertainment and everything of comfort, maybe even have a little self-satisfaction by doing the “good deed”, but can it compensate for the sense of fulfilment a kid gets when he finishes building his sandcastle all on his own?

That excerpt from Harari’s “Sapiens”  doesn’t mean your job has to be something where everything is done by you so that you get that sense of fulfilment. It’s also obvious that today’s jobs are highly specialized, and a person doing a part in a corporation doesn’t even know his impact. The sense of fulfilment is difficult to get, and it becomes more unachievable when you make that same job your whole identity. Like I said earlier, I’m no Robert Frost, and again I’m not saying you to quit your well paying job to go on an “Into the Wild” hunt. 

Ask yourself, “What am I doing these days?” and don’t stop by saying the one thing that seems most important to you. The answer to this question has to be multiple sentences, a paragraph or an essay. “Yes, I’m an assistant regional manager at Dunder Mifflin, also a farmer at Shrute Farms and a great lover of Angela. I’m translating a famous German novel into English and learning martial arts in the evening. I’m also learning the real estate business so that I can rent out properties more effectively.” It’s truly remarkable when you say everything you’re doing; you either feel you are doing so much or nothing. If you feel the former, then congrats, you have climbed a step closer to the sense of fulfilment. If you feel the latter, there’s great advice for what you have to do. 

Sense of fulfilment can imply many things in your life, and it doesn’t have to be only work-related. I started with the work/career example because that was the road we took in the first place. There’s always more to life than one can possibly imagine, and nobody can serve it to you. You are the embodiment of every little thing you do and not just that one goal or the career or the milestone.
