The best time of the year. The greatest pop culture value festival is here. Christmas is definitely that festival which you can't ignore. The colour with the highest wavelength is a pain to the eyes.

I went to my hometown on this occasion because if I can't even visit my family on Christmas then there’s no purpose for my work according to my Mom. In a way, it does sound like what's the purpose of earning money if you can't spend it. Definitely, Christmas is that one time of the year when almost everybody comes back home ...according to my observation as a ten-year-old sitting in the Christmas Eve mass. Pardon, if these feelings aren't relatable for obvious non-Christian reasons. I have a deep-rooted nostalgia for Christmas. My family has always done only one thing on Christmas from the time I gained consciousness enough to remember things, i.e. go to Christmas eve mass. This year was no different, we attended the mass. No wonder I developed the custom of observing people during it and one constant observation was that people came back home on Christmas. I'd find that Bhaiya’s and Didi’s who had gone to some big city for higher education or job would return on Christmas to be with their family. Our church which otherwise had the same people on every Sunday mass, now suddenly gleamed with new faces. For the past four-five years, I’ve become that new face. This Christmas, I hope I did a nice cameo for that scared, observant little kid sitting in the front row and dreaming about cars and solving world hunger. 

I remember a scene from Little Things (a Netflix series about a sub-urban couple), in which a character has an app that estimates how many days will you spend with your parents in this lifetime considering you only visit them x days in a year. This math will really shock you. It's like those stats which say that we spend 1/3rd of our life sleeping. That doesn't mean you try to reduce it to 1/4th. These figures shock us because the human brain isn’t wired to store numbers but stories. An hour of a good time can make us feel warm for years. Stories are what makes humans “human”. Stories are how humans passed down knowledge to the next generation. Numbers limit the capacity of human imagination but it also pushes man to achieve those imaginations because life has an end, marked by numbers on his tombstone.

The math I came up with had really abysmal numbers, which in a way awakened me to spend more quality time with my family. In the end, it’s the nostalgia that we count on. A good old story to tell is all we take from the hardships and struggles of this world.
